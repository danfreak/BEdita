BEdita is in constant development. there is not a graphical user interface for install
procedure. Anyway, as long as you have access to the command line shell, it is quite
simple. Instructions follow.



MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

This requirements should be satisfied. 
You will need a system with:

    * PHP 5.2 or newer with modules gd, mbstring, gettext (recommended)
    * MySQL 5.0.26 or newr version
    * Apache 2
    * access to the command line shell

All third party libraries needed by BEdita are bundled in the source package.



DOWNLOAD BEdita package

You may download the latest stable release at
http://www.bedita.com/download

NB: Unstable releases are also available but not covered by this document. 



WHAT IS IN THE PACKAGE

The package contains everything needed to install BEdita.

Once exapanded, you will find a bunch of files in the root folder: between others,
INSTALL is this setup guide, LICENSE.AGPL contains the AGPL license under which
BEdita open is relased, CHANGES is a log of latest CHANGES.

You will also find the following folders:

- bedita-app
  is the main BEdita is the core application, deployed as a CakePHP application.

- bedita-db
  SQL scripts that are needed to initialize the SQL database.

- cake
  contains the CakePHP framework: please do not manually upgrade CakePHP, since the
  version bundled is the only one tested with current BEdita application.
  
- vendors
  third party libraries, like Smarty template engine and phpThumb for image processing.
  


INSTALL

Now we can proceed to the real setup! Just copy the bedita directory (the content of the 
compressed source package) in a directory served by the web server. Now you have just two 
simple thigs to do:

1. Create the database

Just create an empty database on MySQL and define a mysql user having grants on data 
(INSERT, DELETE, etc....) and on structure (CREATE, DROP, etc....)

2. Launch the shell script bedita init

To initialize the system correctly, BEdita has a PHP script that you have to launch 
from the command line (a cake shell script, more precisely). Just go to the bedita 
directory above on the shell and type:

./cake.sh bedita init

The script first checks your configuration, if it finds something wrong or not properly 
setup it will suggest you what to do. For instance if the database connection fails it 
will tell you variable in wich file to check and edit.

HINT: edit $default array in bedita-app/config/database.php, have a look to cakePHP 
documentation.

Don't worry!

There are just two files to edit, bedita-app/config/database.php for the database 
connection (look at the CakePHP docs) and bedita-app/config/bedita.cfg.php where you
 have to define two fundamental variables for BEdita.

    * the first one is $config['mediaRoot'] that indicates a directory on your filesystem 
    where BEdita will put any file uploaded (through a form) on the syste. Veirfy that 
    the webserver has the right permissions to read and write in this directory.
    * the second is $config['mediaUrl'] that indicates the base URL from wich you can 
    reach the uploaded files.

The simplest place where you can create such a directory is inside bedita-app/webroot. 
Suppose you have created there a media directory the above variables will look like these:

$config['mediaRoot'] = "path_to_bedita_".DS."bedita-app".DS."webroot".DS."media";

$config['mediaUrl'] = "http://www.example.com/bedita/media";

DS stands for the generic directory separator that will be "/" for *nix systems 
(Linux, McOSX,...) ot "\" for Windows systems.

 You can obviously have more complex configurations creating the media directory 
 somewhere else defining a virtual host that points to it (recommended for production systems).

Once the system is correclty configured the script wil create and initialize the database. 
At last it will ask if you want to check the status of BEdita, just press y and you will 
receive a short summary of your configuration.

Be aware of the permissions on bedita-app/tmp directory that has to be recursively writable 
from your webserver.
And now?

Open your browser and write on the address bar the location that points to your BEdita 
installation,

You will redirected to the login page! Type bedita as username and also as password
 et voil√†...have fun with BEdita!!
