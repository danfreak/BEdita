This is a frontend application example inspired by the 2010 theme (http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyten) for WordPress (http://www.wordpress.org).
The main stylesheet is the TwentyTen (twentyten.css) and an adjustament.css is used for some correction.

Note:
The first image you put inside your publication is used as header image.
The image is cropped so if you want to see the entire image then upload a 940x198 px (or multiple) image.
The default WordPress TwentyTen theme is used
